        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "Text preprocessing is an approach for cleaning and preparing text data for NLP tasks before training a model. Various preprocessing steps in an NLP pipeline, including text normalisation techniques for transforming a text into a canonical (standard) form to reduce noise, will be investigated using NLTK and spaCy libraries on AstraZeneca market news articles collected by web scraping from [Investing.com](https://https://www.investing.com/).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Text classification is the problem of assigning categories to text data according to its content. Different techniques to extract information from raw text data for training a classification model will be explored including Bag of Words, TF-IDF and Word Embedding.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the primary applications of NLP is to cut through the noise (high dimensionality from large volumes of text) and identify the signal (extract the main topics). Topic modelling is the practice of using a quantitative algorithm to automatically output the key topics that a body of text is about. Here, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm from the Gensim package will be used.\n",

The government has secured access to 100mln doses of the inoculation on behalf of the whole of the UK, crown dependencies and overseas territories.  More than a million people in the UK have already been vaccinated with the /BioNTech vaccine and its rollout will continue at pace.  However, there has been criticism of the government\\'s plan since the required two doses of both jabs will now be administered 12 weeks apart.  The British Medical Association said cancelling patients booked in for their second doses was \"grossly unfair\", the BBC reported, though the chief medical officers said it is preferable to vaccinate as many as people as possible with the first dose.  Meanwhile, AstraZeneca has applied to get the jab approved in South Korea, while Vietnam has bought 30mln doses and is in talks with other companies to purchase more.

              " ' The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University has been approved by the Indian drug regulator for emergency use, Reuters reported.  India has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases after the US. The AstraZeneca (AZN)/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine is being made locally in India by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and is branded COVISHIELD.  As per Reuters, another vaccine, called COVAXIN, which has been developed locally in India by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research, has also been granted emergency use authorization.  On December 30, AstraZeneca announced that its COVID-19 vaccine was approved for emergency use in the UK for the active immunization of individuals 18 years or older. The authorization recommends two doses administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks. The company is working with its global partners to ramp up its manufacturing capacity of up to three billion vaccine doses globally in 2021 on a rolling basis, pending regulatory approvals.  AstraZeneca’s vaccine can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2-8 degrees Celsius/ 36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months and administered within existing healthcare settings. (See AZN stock analysis on TipRanks)  In December 2020, Morgan Stanley analyst Mark Purcell upgraded AstraZeneca to Buy from Hold and selected it as a preferred large-cap growth stock across the European biopharma sector. One of the reasons cited for the rating upgrade was the strength of the company’s cancer drugs, Calquence and Farxiga. Purcell noted that the company’s oncology pipeline has driven rapid sales growth in the past two years following a number of lean years.  The analyst expects AstraZeneca to deliver 9% sales growth and 19% EPS growth over the next five years.  Overall, the Street has a Strong Buy analyst consensus on the stock based on 6 Buys versus 1 Hold. The average price target of $67.50 indicates an upside potential of 35% from current levels.

              " ' LONDON — The U.K. has started rolling out the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, marking another step in its battle against the coronavirus pandemic.  The country\\'s National Health Service (NHS) is the first in the world to deploy the jab after it was approved for use in the U.K. by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) last week. The NHS said 82-year-old Brian Pinker was the first person in the world to receive the jab Monday morning.  The approval and deployment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is seen as a boon in the race against Covid-19 as it is cheaper than alternatives created by Pfizer and BioNTech and Moderna.  Additionally, and unlike rival vaccines, it can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions (2 to 8 degrees Celsius or 36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months.  When the vaccine was approved last week, AstraZeneca said it aimed \"to supply millions of doses in the first quarter\" as part of its deal with the U.K. government to supply up to 100 million doses in total.  As a two-dose vaccine, the agreement means up to 50 million people in the U.K., which has a population of around 66 million, could be inoculated.  In a statement Monday, the U.K. government said that more than half a million doses are now available \"with tens of millions more to be delivered in the coming weeks and months once batches have been quality checked by the MHRA.\"  The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine adds to a Covid-19 immunization program already started by Britain in December, when it started rolling out the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. More than a million people in the U.K. have already been vaccinated with the Pfizer shot, according to the government. It stated Monday that more than 730 vaccination sites have been established across the U.K. and that hundreds more are opening this week.  As with the Pfizer vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot will be rolled out to priority groups first, including care home residents and staff, people aged over 80 and health and care workers, then to the rest of the population in order of age and risk, including those who are clinically extremely vulnerable.',\n",

Brian Pinker, a retired maintenance manager, was given the shot at 7:30 a.m. GMT from nurse Sam Foster at Oxford’s Churchill Hospital. “I am so pleased to be getting the COVID vaccine today and really proud that it is one that was invented in Oxford,” Pinker said in a statement issued by the National Health Service.  More than half a million doses of the vaccine from drug company AstraZeneca AZN, +0.35% and the University of Oxford shot will be available from Monday, with tens of millions more to be delivered in the coming weeks and months once batches have been quality checked by the regulator, the government said.  The U.K. government has secured access to 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca–Oxford vaccine, which was authorized for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, on Dec. 30.  Shots will be delivered at 730 vaccination sites already established across the U.K., with others opening this week to take the total to more than 1,000, the government said in a statement.  “This is a pivotal moment in our fight against this awful virus and I hope it provides renewed hope to everybody that the end of this pandemic is in sight,” said health secretary Matt Hancock.  Hancock’s comments come almost a month after the U.K. began the rollout of the vaccine developed by U.S. drug company Pfizer PFE, -1.13% and its German partner BioNTech BNTX, +5.81% , with more than 1 million people having now received their first dose of the two-dose shot.  Last week, the MHRA, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization and four U.K. chief medical officers agreed to delay the gap between the first and second doses of vaccines, in a bid to protect the greatest number of people in the shortest amount of time.  The AstraZeneca–Oxford vaccine is easier to transport and store than the Pfizer–BioNTech shot, which has to be kept at minus 70 degrees until shortly before it is used, making it easier to deliver in care homes.  The rollout of the AstraZeneca–Oxford vaccine comes amid a resurging outbreak of coronavirus cases in the U.K., with more than 50,000 new coronavirus cases recorded for the sixth day in a row. On Sunday, 54,990 new infections and 454 deaths were recorded, according to government data.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson told national broadcaster the BBC that tougher measures may be required in parts of the country in the coming weeks to control the rapid spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. “If you look at the numbers, there is no question that we are going to have to take tougher measures and we will be announcing those in due course,” Johnson said. He will set out plans for England in a televised address at 8 p.m. GMT on Monday.  Read: Slow COVID-19 vaccine rollout in U.S. could portend more problems  Earlier on Monday, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced new lockdown rules, with a legal requirement for everyone in mainland Scotland to stay at home, except for essential purposes, from midnight tonight until the end of January.  “As a result of this new variant, [the virus] has just learned to run much faster, and has most definitely picked up pace in the past couple of weeks,” Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament.  Meanwhile, some European Union leaders have come under criticism for the slow pace of their vaccination programs, which began on Dec. 27 using the Pfizer–BioNTech shot.  BioNTech Chief Executive Uğur Şahin told German newspaper Der Spiegel that the process in Europe “certainly wasn’t as fast and straightforward” as in other countries, partly because the EU isn’t directly authorized and member states have a say.  Read: Why France’s blundering COVID vaccination campaign is seen as a Macron fiasco and failure of ‘ruling elite’  The French government has pledged to accelerate the pace of vaccinations after only inoculating just over 350 people with the Pfizer–BioNtech shot in the first six days, compared with Germany’s 238,000. From Monday, medical staff aged 50 and older in France will receive the shots. Vaccines in the Netherlands won’t be administered until Jan. 8, when the IT system required for planning and registering the shots will be ready.  Several European countries are set to extend their lockdowns amid the rise in coronavirus cases.

              " ' As 2020 comes to a close, it’s hard to find a more successful fund manager than Cathie Wood, the chief executive and chief investment officer of ARK Invest.  ARK’s flagship fund, the ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, -0.36% , has jumped 154% this year, trouncing the 43% rise for the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.97% , and other ARK funds including the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF ARKG, -0.57% also have had meteoric gains. The only real sour note came this week, with both losses in the funds and, uniquely, outflows. But according to FactSet Research, the innovation fund has drawn in $9.4 billion in flows this year, the genomic fund has gobbled up $5 billion in assets, and its next-generation internet fund ARKW, -1.19% has attracted close to $3 billion in flows.  In a note to clients this week, Wood said there are five “innovation platforms” companies need to invest in, or lose their way: DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology. These platforms involve 14 technologies including gene therapies, 3-D printing, cloud computing, big data analytics, and cryptocurrencies, she said.  This technological innovation puts at risk whole swaths of industries — energy, industrials, consumer discretionary, communications services, health care, and financial services, which compose more than half the S&P 500 SPX, -1.93% , she said.  Traditional equity and fixed income benchmarks are being populated increasingly by so-called value traps, stocks and bonds that are “cheap” for a reason, she added.  There is an economic forecast attached to this upheaval. “If our forecasts for the five innovation platforms are near the mark, nominal GDP growth in the U.S. is likely to slow from 4.1% at an annual rate during the past five years to 2-3%, regaining momentum only after new technologies and solutions gain enough critical mass to move the economic needle,” she said. Both volume growth and inflation will come in on the low side of expectations.  The buzz  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not bring up a vote on $2,000 stimulus checks unless attached to provisions that would strip legal protections for companies including Google owner Alphabet GOOG, -2.14% and social media platform Facebook FB, -2.25% , as well as establish a commission to look at President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud.  Betting markets continue to favor Republicans, while the latest polls in Georgia are trending in the direction of the Democrats taking both the Senate runoff seats, which would give the party the control of both chambers of Congress as well as the presidency.  Attention on the coronavirus front continues to be on the slow rollout of vaccines in the U.S. as much as the heightening toll the virus is taking. Daily hospitalizations reached 125,220 as deaths totaled 3,903, according to the COVID-19 tracking project, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 2.8 million have started the vaccination process. China approved its first vaccine, from state-owned conglomerate Sinopharm 1099, +0.64% , which says it is 79% effective, while the U.S. might not approve the vaccine from pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca AZN, +0.22% until April, according to a top Trump administration health official.  Oil producer Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.29% said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it plans to take a write-down of as much as $20 billion in the fourth quarter.

Enphase Energy ENPH, -1.82% is going to replace Tiffany, which is being acquired, in the S&P 500 index, S&P Dow Jones Indices announced.  The U.S. said it would subject the European Union to additional tariffs, on aircraft manufacturing parts from France and Germany, nonsparkling wine from France and Germany, and cognac, in what it said was a response to the EU’s calculation of how it imposed U.S. tariffs. The broader, long-running dispute is over state aid to plane makers Boeing BA, -4.45% and Airbus AIR, +0.12% .  Weekly jobless claims fell by 19,000 to a seasonally adjusted 787,000 in the period ending Dec. 26, which was upwardly revised by 3,000.  The chart  Ronnie Walker, an economist at Goldman Sachs, finds that the labor market hasn’t changed much — either for the better, or the worse — since the November employment report. The good news is there hasn’t been much scarring effect from the COVID-19 pandemic. Two-thirds of the 25 million jobs initially lost since the onset of the pandemic have returned, and 42% of the newly unemployed since February say they are on temporary layoff, he said.

              " ' Wall Street on Thursday is looking forward to a farewell to a pandemic-stricken year in the last trading day of 2020.  U.S. stock markets, energy CL.1, -1.81% and gold futures GC00, +2.44% will be open for the full trading day on New Year’s Eve, while the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association recommends a 2 p.m. close for trading in bonds, including the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, 0.908% .  Most global financial markets will be closed on Friday, Jan. 1, for New Year’s Day.  Check out: ‘Santa Claus’ rally has begun. Why few 7-session stretches are better for the stock market.  Equity markets are aiming to wrap up December, the fourth quarter and 2020 on a high note after a historic, gut-wrenching year that will go down in the annals of financial-market history.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.80% is set to close out the month up 2.6%, with a 6.6% year-to-date gain so far, and a 9.5% rise over the final three months of the year, according to FactSet data.

The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.93% is looking at a 3.1% advance in December and a 15.5% annual return, aided by an 11% surge in the quarter, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.97% is on track for a 5.5% rally on the month and a 43% year-to-date rise, with a 15.25% gain since the start of October.  Perhaps even more impressive, the small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, -2.05% has gained 8.8% in December and nearly 19% in the year to date, capped by a record-setting return in the final three months of the year of more than 31%.  Read: Stock-market pros are having a tough time imagining an S&P 500 slump in 2021  Still, the economic and emotional toll in a year marked by the COVID-19 pandemic has been great, and is likely to continue into 2021. It’s unclear what lies ahead as the viral spread continues even as vaccines from Pfizer PFE, -1.10% -BioNTech BNTX, +5.79% , Moderna MRNA, +5.65% and AstraZeneca AZN, +0.22% are being rolled out.  The U.S. set a fresh record for hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 on Wednesday, with 124,686 patients in U.S. hospitals, breaking the record set on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the first cases of a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus were found in Colorado and California.  The U.S. continues to lead the world in cases, at 19.6 million, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, and fatalities, at 340,004, or about a fifth of the global tally for each.  The path forward looks like a challenging one, but American businesses and workers are looking to bring more fight to the battle in the coming year, with market participants also harboring tons of optimism.',\n",
              " ' The MHRA approved the 2-dose vaccine that will require a 2nd dose to be administered 4-12 weeks after the first dose.  It wasn’t long ago that AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford hit the news wires for all the wrong reasons.  With dosages now cleared up and the ability to store the AstraZeneca vaccine at fridge temperatures, mass vaccination is far simpler across the UK and beyond.  More importantly for the UK, there is also greater control on production and distribution, with the vaccine produced in the UK.  In addition to the Pfizer Inc. and Monero Inc. vaccines, the UK expects to receive an estimated 530,000 doses next week.  In the UK, a total of 616,933 people received the vaccine between 8th and 20th December. The government has ordered 40 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer Inc. vaccine and 100 million AstraZeneca doses.  Other vaccines that are also available including Russia’s Sputnik V, which is being considered across other geographies.',\n",
              " ' The market finished strong yesterday due to more positive news on the vaccine front and stimulus checks that should soon reach American’s bank accounts. This optimism has been outweighing worsening coronavirus trends, as the new strain found in the UK was just discovered in the U.S.  With one more trading day left for the year, it’s time to look ahead to 2021. As the vaccine continues to roll out, the economy should begin to see a stronger recovery, especially with a favorable monetary policy and new fiscal stimulus. That’s why I am recommending investors start to consider small-cap stocks that could benefit from faster economic growth, including NETGEAR, Inc. (NTGR), ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN), and Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (APOG).  But before we get into those stocks, let’s take a look at the markets over the past few days.  Market Commentary  The market started strong on Monday after President Trump signed the long-awaited $2.3 trillion spending bill. Then on Tuesday, all three major indices hit intraday record highs before turning negative. Investors were initially optimistic that they would receive larger stimulus checks, but that hope dimmed later in the day after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked a vote for $2,000 stimulus checks.  Stocks were in the green yesterday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a record closing high. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also closed near their own closing highs. The market was boosted by more positive vaccine news as AstraZeneca’s (AZN) vaccine became the second vaccine authorized in the UK. Stocks were also driven by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s announcement on Tuesday that $600 stimulus checks could begin arriving this week.  Market Outlook  As we head into the new year, the economy looks primed for faster growth due to several factors. First, Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that he will keep interest rates near zero for as long as it takes to bolster the economy and the markets. With rates so low, the market’s rise should continue for quite some time.  The economic recovery is already underway as economic activity rebounded in the third quarter. We are also seeing improving forecasts for earnings and revenues for 2021. The new stimulus bill should also help. Second, the news on the vaccine front continues to provide hope that the end of the pandemic is near. While the rollout hasn’t been perfect, we now have four companies in the process of providing vaccines.  One area that I see benefiting from a strong economy is small-cap stocks. Small-cap companies have historically benefited from faster economic growth. There is already a jump in improved forecasts for small-cap stock earnings. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-cap stocks, is up 28.3% since late October. I expect that to continue as we head into 2021. That’s why I am highlighting three small-cap stocks that I am bullish on.  NETGEAR, Inc. (NTGR)  NTGR is a provider of networking solutions. The company offers Internet-connected products for networking, broadband access, and network connectivity. NTGR has already benefited from the work from home trend as it saw strong demand for connected home products. The company holds a competitive edge in Wi-Fi with 44% and 49% of the share in U.S. retail Wi-Fi and switch markets.  Even as people get back into the office, the company is poised to continue growing due to its latest technological innovations. Due to the increasing demand for cloud-based applications for businesses, the company is introducing next generation commercial products. Earnings estimates for both the current year and next year have increased by 28.8% and 21.7%.  The stock is rated a “Strong Buy” in our POWR Ratings system. It holds a grade of “A” in Trade Grade, Buy & Hold Grade, Peer Grade, and a “B” for Industry Rank. It is also ranked #9 in the Technology – Communication/Networking industry.  ADTRAN, Inc. (ADTN)  ADTN is another provider of networking and broadband infrastructure solutions. The company serves a diverse domestic and international customer base in multiple countries, including Tier-1, 2, 3 service providers, cable, and distributed enterprises. Its solutions and services enable voice, data, video, and internet communications across a variety of network infrastructures.  The company is benefiting from fiber access advancements, which should drive future growth. Earnings are expected to grow 95.5% next quarter. The company expects a pickup in corporate capital spending that should drive growth in its domestic markets for ultra-broadband and Fiber-To-The-Home solutions.  The stock is rated a “Buy” in our POWR Ratings system. It holds a grade of “A” for Trade Grade and a “B” for Buy & Hold Grade, Peer Grade, and Industry Rank.  Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (APOG)  APOG manufactures architectural glass and metal glass framings and provides building glass installation services. The company is poised to gain from an increase in market share, an expansion into new markets, and the launch of new products. APOG has a large backlog in its Architectural Services segment, which should drive growth over the short and mid-term.  In fact, the company’s Architectural Services segment continues to win new projects as it sees strong demand from new construction activities. APOG has also undertaken cost-cutting initiatives that have not only bolstered its latest earnings report but should also improve its working capital and cash flow.  The stock is rated a “Strong Buy” in our POWR Ratings system. It holds a grade of “A” for Trade Grade and Buy & Hold Grade, and a “B” for Industry Rank. APOG is also the #14 rated stock in the Industrial-Building Materials industry.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 SXPP, +3.64% index was down 0.4% in thin trading on a day when some major European exchanges are closed, such as Frankfurt, or operate on a shortened trading day, as in Paris.  In the latest development of a 16-year trans-Atlantic dispute over public subsidies to aircraft manufacturers Airbus AIR, +0.12% and Boeing BA, -4.46% , the U.S. administration said overnight that it would raise tariffs on additional European goods, including nonsparkling wines and brandies from France and Germany.

The French wine exporters’ federation told Reuters the measures could cost the industry more than €1 billion ($1.2 billion) in lost revenue. But the European Commission said in a release that it would engage with the incoming administration of U.S. president-elect “at the earliest possible moment” with the aim of finding “a lasting solution to the dispute.”  Meanwhile, French luxury-goods makers LVMH MC, +0.23% , Kering KER, -2.30% and Hermès International RMS, +0.55% were among the top risers on the Paris stock exchange.  LVMH, the owner of brands such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moët Champagne, said it would close its acquisition of Tiffany on Jan. 7, after shareholders of the U.S. jeweler “overwhelmingly” approved its revised offer on Wednesday.  The U.K. House of Commons on Wednesday massively voted to ratify the U.K.-EU trade deal concluded last week, which became law in the early hours of Thursday, clearing the way for an orderly exit from the European markets. But investors in London focused on another layer of strict measures announced by the government, such as a postponement of school openings due next week.  International Consolidated Airlines IAG, -6.23% , the owner of the U.K.’s flagship carrier British Airways, was among the biggest decliners in London, down more than 3% on concerns about more reduced travel in the first half of 2021.  The shares of AstraZeneca AZN, +1.34% , the pharmaceuticals group whose COVID vaccine was approved earlier this week by the U.K. regulator, were down 1.8% after a top Trump administration official indicated that Americans wouldn’t get the vaccine before April, as doubts remain about its effectiveness.  The British pound rose 0.2% against the undefined and 0.5% against the undefined. The British currency has risen by 3% against the U.S. currency this year, but fallen 5.5% against the euro.  The London Stock Exchange was on track to end the year having significantly underperformed all other major European bourses, with the FTSE 100 having lost 15% in 2020, compared with an 8% decline for the French CAC40 and a 2.5% rise of Germany’s DAX DAX, +0.06% index.  The opening of trading on Jan. 4 after the year-end market closure will mark the first day of the London Stock Exchange operating outside the EU’s regulatory area, and the end of the direct access to European markets that U.K.-based financial players enjoyed before Brexit.

              " ' Oil Moves Higher After Bullish Inventory Report  Oil managed to settle above the $48 level after API Crude Oil Stock Change report indicated that crude inventories decreased by 4.8 million barrels while analysts expected that they would decline by 2.1 million barrels.  This data will still have to be confirmed by the EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report which will be published today. Traditionally, traders focus mostly on the EIA data so oil may find itself under pressure if this report disappoints.  At this point, oil looks ready to test the psychologically important $50 level in early 2021 despite the continued problems on the coronavirus front and OPEC+ decision to increase production by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January, which is good for energy-related stocks.

With a record 53,000 new cases yesterday, the UK remains on a sharp upward trajectory with no sign of turning the corner. The fear is that without a swift reversal in cases, there is a strong chance that the government either lengthens or tightens restrictions further.”  But he continued: “The outlook for 2021 looks positive given today’s UK approval of the crucial /Oxford vaccine.

Although many Republican Senators remain adamantly opposed to increasing relief payments, support is growing among them, including two from Georgia, who are running in crucial races that will determine who will control the Senate.  The Senate is also due to hold a procedural vote on Wednesday that could pave the way for Congress to override President Trump’s veto of a key defense bill, as tension between the outgoing Republican president and party leaders grows.  Trump on Tuesday ramped-up pressure on his fellow Republicans to support his decision to veto the bill because it does not repeal certain legal protections for tech giants, and to back $2,000 one-time stimulus checks for struggling Americans.

              " ' U.K. stocks traded below flat on Wednesday, as Parliament approved the post-Brexit trade deal and the U.K. became the first country to approve the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford.  The FTSE 100 UKX, +1.72% , the index of London’s top stocks by market capitalization, was 0.2% lower on Wednesday.  London joined European markets in trading near flat in the middle of a week bookended by holidays. The London Stock Exchange will close at 12:30 p.m. on Thursday for New Year’s Eve and will be closed on Friday.  The U.K. took centerstage during a quiet day in Europe, as the landmark post-Brexit trade deal is signed into law in London, completing the preparations for the U.K.’s final exit from the European Union at the end of this year.  The deal, which governs the future trading relationship between the EU and the U.K., received unanimous support from ambassadors of the bloc’s 27 member states on Monday, and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed the legislation through Parliament in one day.

Here’s What It Means for Markets and Investors.  The U.K. also became the first country to approve the COVID-19 vaccine developed by pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca AZN, +1.34% and the University of Oxford, after the country’s medical regulator authorized it for emergency use.  Health secretary Matt Hancock said in an interview with the BBC that the approval of the AstraZeneca–Oxford University shot gives the U.K. enough vaccines to cover the entire population.  The approval comes as the U.K. moved more of its population into lockdown, with three-quarters of England to live under the strictest tier of restrictions, and the government considering whether to delay the return of schools in the new year.  “The British pound is in a good mood too, bolstered by the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine being approved for use in the U.K., something that could hasten the journey towards vaccinating large swathes of the population,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, analyst at XM.  The pound has rallied 0.76% against the dollar, touching the $1.361 mark earlier on Wednesday.  Hadjikyriacos added that “with Brexit out of the spotlight for now, the main variable for sterling may be the vaccine deployment timeline, as that could determine how soon the rolling shutdown game ends and how quickly the economy heals.”  AstraZeneca’s shares opened 1.5% higher, setting near flat, on the back of the COVID-19 vaccine approval. These built on gains from earlier in the week, when the stock surged around 4% in anticipation of the regulatory clearance.

              " ' The U.S. set a fresh record for hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 on Wednesday, and the country’s first case of the highly infectious U.K variant of the coronavirus was found in Colorado, as health experts continued to lament the delayed rollout of vaccines that is hampering the economic recovery.  The much-ballyhooed granting of emergency-use authorizations for two leading vaccines in December — one developed by Pfizer Inc. PFE, -1.08% with German partner BioNTech SE BNTX, +5.84% and one developed by the biotech company Moderna Inc. MRNA, +5.80% — had raised hopes that the pandemic could soon be contained.  But the U.S. vaccine rollout is happening at a far slower pace than was promised by the Trump administration’s “Operation Warp Speed,” a federal government program created to accelerate the development of vaccines and therapies. The initial promise was for 100 million doses to be delivered by year-end, which was later reduced to 40 million and then 20 million.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has created a tracking tool to monitor the pace of vaccination, but as of Wednesday morning it had not updated since Monday, Dec. 28, when it showed just 2.1 million people had been given the first of two doses and 11.4 million vaccines had been distributed.  Dr. Leana Wen, a practicing physician and former health commissioner for the city of Baltimore, told CNN a lot has gone wrong with the distribution program, starting with an initial overpromising by the Trump administration.  “Another is diffusion of responsibility. In a way, that sounds a lot like the testing debacle, that there is no national strategy. States are supposed to figure it out on their own but without the resources and guidance they need,” she said.  “I’m really concerned because vaccines were meant to be how we get out of where we are, and it just pains me, and I’m sure many of us, so much, because there are millions of vaccines sitting in warehouses, and there are thousands of people dying every day.”  President-elect Joe Biden added his voice to the criticism on Tuesday, lamenting at a press briefing that “the effort is not progressing as it should.”  Biden created a pandemic task force shortly after his election in early November, saying his administration would be “informed by science and by experts.” On Tuesday, he allowed that the continuing battle against the public health crisis represented the “greatest operational challenge we’ve ever faced as a nation.”  However, “If it continues to move as it is now, it’s going to take years, not months, to vaccinate the American people,” Biden added. He said his incoming administration “will spare no effort to make sure people get vaccinated” and noted that he pledged earlier this month to get “at least 100 million COVID vaccine shots into the arms of the American people in the first 100 days.”  See also:Biden joins public health experts in expressing dismay as early days of COVID vaccine rollout in U.S. fall far short of expectations  White House incumbent Donald Trump, defeated by Biden in November, had this to say:  The U.S. recorded at least 3,626 fatalities from COVID-19 on Tuesday, according to a New York Times tracker, and another 200,902 new cases. The country has averaged 183,030 cases every day for the last week. The U.S. continues to lead the world in cases, at 19.6 million, according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University, and fatalities, at 340,004, or about a fifth of the global tally for each.  The U.S. set a fresh record for hospitalizations with COVID-19, according to the COVID Tracking Project. There are now 124,686 patients in U.S. hospitals, breaking the record set a day ago.  Officials in Colorado reported the first known case of the COVID-19 variant that has been moving fast across the U.K., which experts say is more infectious, but does not make people sicker. The case involves a man in his 20s, who is in isolation in Elbert County and has no travel history, according to a tweet from Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat.  The U.K. granted emergency-use authorization to the vaccine that has been developed by AstraZeneca PLC and Oxford University, making it the third vaccine to be deployed in the U.K. in the pandemic, after the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna ones.  At a press conference, regulators cited the overall 70% effectiveness rate the AstraZeneca vaccine achieved in both of its dosing studies. They also advised against a mixing-and-match approach to administering the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.  An advantage the AstraZeneca vaccine has over the Pfizer one is that it can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, rather than needing supercold storage. AstraZeneca plans to make up to 3 billion vaccines to be distributed throughout the developing world.  The U.K. government said the authorization will allow for the country’s entire population to be vaccinated. The U.K. has been effectively isolated from the rest of the world, as the new variant has rapidly spread.  In other news:  • Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. REGN, -1.15% said initial data from its Phase 1/2/3 clinical trial of its antibody cocktail in hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring low-flow oxygen passed a futility analysis, meaning there was sufficient efficacy to warrant continuing the trial. “The results passed the futility analysis (p<0.3 one-sided), as seronegative patients treated with the antibody cocktail had a lower risk of death or receiving mechanical ventilation (HR: 0.78; 80% CI: 0.51-1.2),” the company said in a statement. “The benefit was driven by results starting one week post-treatment, when the risk of death or receiving mechanical ventilation was reduced by approximately half with antibody cocktail treatment, based on a post-hoc analysis.” The company is pinning its hopes on the U.K.-based Recovery trial to provide further evidence the antibody helps lower the risk of death. That trial has enrolled more than 2,000 hospitalized patients. The antibody cocktail, reportedly used in the treatments of President Trump, Trump cabinet member Ben Carson and Trump adviser Chris Christie, was granted emergency-use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November.  • Luke Letlow, an incoming Republican member of the U.S. House from Louisiana, died Tuesday night from complications related to COVID-19 only days before being sworn into office, the AP reported. He was 41. He was admitted to a Monroe, La., hospital on Dec. 19 after testing positive for the coronavirus disease. He was later transferred to the Shreveport facility and placed in intensive care. Letlow campaigned at indoor locations without wearing a face mask, the Washington Post reported, and warned of the danger posed to the economy by measures put in place to arrest the virus’s spread.  See now:CDC issues COVID-19 vaccine guidance for Americans with HIV, Guillain-Barré and other underlying conditions  • California is extending a strict stay-at-home order as hospital intensive-care units are running out of beds, the AP reported. Dr. Mark Ghaly, the state’s top health official, said that Southern California and the agricultural San Joaquin Valley still have what is considered no ICU capacity to treat patients suffering from the coronavirus and that the state’s restrictions would continue in those regions. Much of the state is under orders to stay home. Ghaly implored the state’s 40 million residents to do just that, and to continue social distancing and wearing masks if they must go out this holiday weekend. He said that while hospital and positivity rates appear to be stabilizing from a Thanksgiving-related surge, that isn’t the case in the southern part of the state, including Los Angeles County.  • Germany suffered a record number of deaths from COVID-19 on Wednesday, just days after launching a vaccination program, the Guardian reported. The number of confirmed cases rose by 22,459 to 1.7 million, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases. The death toll rose by 1,129 to 32,107.  Americans Face New Financial Realities Nine Months Into Pandemic  Latest tallies  The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide climbed above 82 million on Wednesday, the Johns Hopkins data show, and the death toll rose to 1.79 million. At least 46 million people have recovered from COVID-19.  Brazil has the second highest death toll at 192,681 and is third by cases at 7.6 million.  India is second worldwide in cases with 10.2 million, and third in deaths at 148,439.  Mexico has the fourth highest death toll at 123,845 and 13th highest case tally at 1.4 million.  Italy has 73,604 fatalities, the highest in Europe, and 2.1 million cases. The U.K. has 2.4 million cases, the most in Europe, and 712,656, second-highest in Europe and sixth highest in the world.  China, where the virus was first discovered late last year, has had 95,797 confirmed cases and 4,777 deaths, according to its official numbers.  What’s the economy saying?  A measure of business conditions in the Chicago area rose December, bucking a trend in other parts of the country where growth has slowed in the face of a record coronavirus outbreak, MarketWatch’s Jeffry Bartash reported.  The Chicago PMI edged up to 59.5 from 58.2, its first increase in three months. Reading above 50 indicate an expanding economy.  Measures of employment and production both improved, but the growth in new orders slipped a bit.  Looking ahead, 45% of the business executives surveyed expect sales to grow less than 5% in 2021. And 43% see growth ranging from 5% to 10%. Most companies said they are unsure if they will adjust their spending plans next year because of the rollout of the coronavirus vaccines. That indicates they are taking a wait-and-see attitude.  The Chicago PMI is the last of the regional manufacturing indices before the national ISM factory data for December is released next Tuesday.  Separately, the U.S. trade deficit in goods climbed 5.5% in November to a record high, reflecting weaker U.S. exports tied to the coronavirus pandemic.  The trade gap in goods widened to $84.8 billion in November from a revised $80.4 billion in October, the government said Wednesday. Imports of goods such as consumer electronics and industrial supplies rose 2.6% to $212 billion in November. Goods imports were up 5.5% compared with a year earlier. Exports rose less than 1% to $127.2 billion, however, and they are down 6.6% compared with one year ago.',\n",
              " ' The London markets wobbled into the red as virus concerns overtook initial optimism following the approval of the AstraZeneca and University of Oxford vaccine in the UK and the passing of the Brexit Bill in Parliament.  Stocks receded after the FTSE 100 had stormed to a new nine-month high on Tuesday after confirmation of the UK’s deal to exit the EU.  Sentiment slumped in the afternoon after the Government announced plans to place more areas of the UK into severe Tier 4 restrictions, weighing down on retail stocks.  The FTSE 100 closed 46.83 points lower at 6,555.82 at the end of trading on Wednesday.  Joshua Mahony, IG senior market analyst, said: “UK stocks are on the back foot despite the passing of the Brexit Bill, putting to bed fears of a no-deal Brexit when the UK leaves the EU on Thursday night.  “Unfortunately, it appears to be the case of a buy-the-rumour, sell-the-fact scenario.  “With a record 53,000 new cases yesterday, the UK remains on a sharp upward trajectory with no sign of turning the corner.  “The fear is that without a swift reversal in cases, there is a strong chance that the Government either lengthens or tightens restrictions further.”  Elsewhere in Europe, the other major markets also closed in the red amid the broad downturn in sentiment.  The German Dax was 0.31% lower and the French Cac moved 0.22% lower.  In the US, the three major indices all rallied due to impending stimulus and optimism driven by the ongoing rollout of coronavirus vaccines, as the US dollar slid to a two-year low.  Meanwhile, sterling soared higher on the back of weakness in the US greenback.  The pound increased by 0.77% versus the US dollar at 1.360 and was up 0.54% against the euro at 1.107.  Non-essential retailers such as Dunelm and Next dropped in value after changes to regional tiers across the country forced stores to shut their doors to customers.  In company news, shares in AstraZeneca closed lower despite UK regulators finally granting approval for its vaccine to be used.  The Government said the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had given the jab the green light, with 530,000 doses available for rollout from Monday. Shares in AstraZeneca closed 61p lower at 7,401p.  Elsewhere, Paddy Power owner Flutter increased in value after it completed its $4.2 billion (£3.1bn) deal to increase its stake in US fantasy sports firm FanDuel to 95%. Shares moved 25p higher to 15,300p.  Shares in outsourcing solutions business iEnergizer leapt after it inked a new $165 million (£121.2m) credit facility. It closed 33p higher at 303p as it confirmed “a further announcement on a return of cash to shareholders” will be made in due course.

FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians wearing facial masks are reflected on an electric board showing stock prices outside a brokerage at a business district in Tokyo 2/2  By Stephen Culp  NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street edged higher and the dollar dipped to its lowest in more than two years on Wednesday, the penultimate trading day in a remarkable year of pandemic, recession and recovery.  All three major U.S. stock indexes were up modestly as recently enacted stimulus and the ongoing rollout of COVID-19 vaccines fed optimism over economic recovery in 2021.  \"2021 is going to be the beginning of it,\" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. \"My anticipation will probably be more robust in the latter part of 2021.\"  \"Once there\\'s the sense of an all-clear sign, we would anticipate a robust response from the consumer,\" Keator added.  For now, Keator suggests the markets are in wait-and-see mode.  \"The markets are saying \\'what have you done for me lately?\\' and people are going to be focusing on what\\'s going to happen if we see more and more restrictions due to the pandemic,\" he said.  Britain approved a coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca in the latest development in the rapid progression, testing, approval and deployment of drugs to battle the disease.

The pan-European index lost 0.34% and MSCI\\'s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.33%.  Emerging market stocks rose 1.70%. MSCI\\'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.81% higher, while lost 0.45%.  U.S. Treasury yields were slightly lower in thin trading as investors bet that Republicans were unlikely to approve the passage of proposed $2,000 stimulus checks.  Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 0.9264%, from 0.935% late on Tuesday.  The 30-year bond last rose 9/32 in price to yield 1.6623%, from 1.674% late on Tuesday.

Crude oil prices inched higher on the back of the weaker dollar and a dip in U.S. inventories, but gains were capped by dimming hopes of a demand rebound.  futures gained 0.83% to settle at $48.40 per barrel and settled at $51.34 per barrel, up 0.49% on the day.

        "\n",
        "Stemming and lemmatisation are text normalisation techniques within NLP that are used to prepare text, words, and documents for further processing and both generate the root form of the inflected words.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5.1 Stemming\n",
        "\n",
        "Stemming is the process of removing the suffix from a word to reduce inflected/derived words to their word stem, base or root form. There are many ways to perform stemming such as lookup table, suffix-stripping algorithms etc. These mainly rely on chopping off ‘s’, ‘es’, ‘ed’, ‘ing’, ‘ly’ etc from the end of the words until the stem is reached. \n",
        "\n",
        "Stemming is a somewhat crude method for cataloguing related words and sometimes the conversion is not desirable. The stem might not be an actual word, and English has many exceptions where a more sophisticated process is required to overcome the two main stemming errors of over-stemming and under-stemming. Nevertheless, stemming helps in standardising text and follows an algorithm with steps to perform on the words which makes it simpler and faster than lemmatisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most common — and effective — stemming algorithms is the **Porter Stemmer** developed by Martin Porter in 1980. It is based on the idea that the suffixes in the English language are made up of a combination of smaller and simpler suffixes. The algorithm employs five phases of word reduction, each with its own set of mapping rules. \n",

        "\n",
        "Lemmatisation is typically seen as much more accurate than simple stemming, which is why spaCy has opted to have only lemmatisation available instead of stemming, ensuring that morphological variants are always actual words.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, if speed and performance are a priority then stemming should be used since lemmatisers scan a corpus which consumes time and processing power. Ultimately, it depends on the application you are working on. For example, if you are building a language application in which language is important you should choose lemmatisation and use a corpus to match root forms.\n",
        "\n",
        "NLTK is a string processing library. It takes strings as input and returns strings or lists of strings as output. Whereas, spaCy uses an object-oriented approach. When we parse a text, spaCy returns a document object whose words and sentences are objects themselves.\n",
        "\n",
        "In word tokenisation and POS-tagging spaCy performs better, but in sentence tokenisation, NLTK outperforms spaCy.\n",
        "\n",
        "spaCy has support for word vectors whereas NLTK does not. spaCy also comes with pre-trained language models which can be used for better part-of-speech (POS) tagging, and named entity recognition (NER) to find out whether or not a word is a named entity, such as persons, locations, organisations, etc."

The model builds a vocabulary from a corpus of documents and is only concerned with keeping track of word counts and whether known words occur in the document, not the order or structure of the words. Each word in the vocabulary becomes a feature and a document is represented by a vector with the same length as the vocabulary (a “bag of words”).\n",
